//! Agent Skills — reusable, self-improving procedures Rusty exposes to Claude Code.
//!
//! Rusty drives the Claude Code CLI as a subprocess, which natively supports
//! [Agent Skills](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills): `SKILL.md` files that
//! Claude discovers, lazily loads, and invokes via its built-in `Skill` tool. Rather
//! than reimplement discovery/invocation, Rusty *rides* that mechanism — it owns
//! authoring, governance, and surfacing, while Claude Code owns loading and invocation.
//!
//! ## On-disk layout
//!
//! ```text
//! ~/.rusty/skills/                 # the `skills_path` setting; passed via `--add-dir`
//! ├── .claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md   # ACTIVE skills (the only discoverable location)
//! ├── staging/<name>/SKILL.md          # PENDING auto-authored skills (NOT discoverable)
//! └── .git/                            # version history (auto-commit, added in a later feature)
//! ```
//!
//! The `.claude/skills/` nesting is deliberate: it is exactly the path Claude Code
//! discovers inside a directory added with `--add-dir`. Granting `--add-dir` the
//! *root* (`~/.rusty/skills`) — not the whole `~/.rusty` — scopes the subprocess's
//! native file tools to skills only (the database `~/.rusty/rusty.db` is a sibling,
//! outside the grant). Note `--add-dir` grants read **and write** to that dir; see
//! `docs/SKILLS-SYSTEM.md` for the threat-model discussion.
//!
//! The read API ([`SkillsManager::list`], [`SkillsManager::get`], [`Skill`],
//! [`parse_skill_md`], …) backs the not-yet-built CLI / MCP / GUI consumers
//! (Features 2–7); [`access_from_settings`] and [`bootstrap`] are the live entry points.

  The brain loop: consult the brain before a decision (brain_ask), record the decision as
  a page linked to what it rested on (brain_decide), come back to say how it went
  (brain_follow_up). Use before any change of direction, design choice or tool pick.
---

Rusty's brain holds facts; this loop adds the reasoning. Two hooks make the first two
steps happen in a repository wired to Rusty (a `.mcp.json` with a `rusty` server): the
first file write waits for a `brain_ask`, and a session that wrote files cannot stop
without a `brain_decide` or a `brain_no_decision`.

## Ask

Before you decide, call `brain_ask` with the question in plain words. It returns the
pages that touch it (text and vectors when a provider is set), the decisions already
taken on the topic with their status, the follow-ups due, and a consultation id. Read
what came back; a decision already taken and kept is the answer unless you have a reason
it no longer holds.

## Decide

Call `brain_decide` with the consultation id, a title, the choice, the rationale, the
alternatives you set aside, and a `follow_up_by` date when the outcome is worth checking
(a week for a tool pick, a month for a design). The page lands under `decisions/`, links
to every consulted page, and each of those pages gets a timeline entry. To replace an
earlier decision, pass its slug as `supersedes`.

When the consultation led to no decision, say so: `brain_no_decision` with the reason.
That is the honest exit, and the Stop hook accepts it.

## Follow up

When the date comes (`brain_due`, the Decisions view, `/brief`), call
`brain_follow_up` with the slug, the outcome and a status: `kept` (clears the date),
`revised` (a new `follow_up_by`), or `superseded` (with the successor's slug).

## From a terminal

`rusty-cli brain ask <question>`, `brain decide <id> --title T --choice C --rationale R
[--alt A]... [--follow-up-by DATE] [--supersedes SLUG]`, `brain follow-up <slug> --status
kept|revised|superseded --outcome O [--successor SLUG]`, `brain no-decision <id> <reason>`,
`brain due [--days N]`. `rusty-cli hooks install` wires the two hooks into
`~/.claude/settings.json`; `hooks status` shows them; `hooks uninstall` removes them.

Use this when a durable, sourced fact should land in the brain vault rather than only in chat.

## Procedure
1. Find or create the target page:
   - Search first: `rusty-cli brain search "<topic>"`
   - If nothing fits: `rusty-cli brain new concept "<Topic>"`
2. Append the finding together with its source:
   `rusty-cli brain append <slug> "<one-line summary>" --detail "<source URL + short quote>"`
3. Signal the GUI to reload: `rusty-cli refresh`

## Pitfalls
- NEVER put a standalone `---` rule in a brain page body — `brain set` treats it as the
  compiled-truth / timeline separator and will split or duplicate the page. Divide sections
  with headings instead.

## Verification
- `rusty-cli brain search "<topic>"` returns the finding with its source.

  Edit prose into sharper, more human writing while preserving the writer's voice, or
  detect AI-slop patterns without rewriting. Use when a draft should read clearer, more
  direct, or less AI-sounding, and whenever you write prose yourself — notes, brain pages,
  docs, commit messages, summaries, or a long answer. Keywords: writing, edit, draft,
  rewrite, voice, tone, AI slop.
---

Be a sharp human editor. Keep the writer's point and voice; remove AI patterns without
turning distinctive writing into generic polished prose.

## Two jobs

**Edit (default).** Someone hands you a draft. Make the minimum effective edit, then
return the full edited draft plus a short **What changed** section.

**Detect.** Someone asks whether a piece reads as AI, or asks for an audit. Name each
pattern below that appears, quote the line, give the fix in a few words. Don't rewrite,
don't score it, don't guess whether AI wrote it. Offer to edit afterward.

**Your own prose.** Apply the rules silently as you write. No *What changed* section, no
announcement. Code, identifiers, log strings, and quoted source material are exempt —
copy quoted material exactly, banned words and all.

## Principles

- Preserve the writer's real voice: vocabulary, cadence, bluntness, humor, uncertainty,
  digressions, level of polish. Don't make every paragraph equally tidy.
- Make the minimum effective edit. Leave strong human sentences alone.
- Lead with the point when the setup adds nothing. Keep a personal aside when it creates
  context, tension, or character.
- Don't invent claims, examples, stats, or opinions. If something is unclear, ask.
- Open it up, don't dumb it down. Strip jargon, long sentences, abstract nouns, and
  tangled structure; keep the substance and precision.
- Use active voice. Never let inanimate things do human verbs.
- Be concrete: names, numbers, dates, mechanisms. "The integration improved efficiency"
  becomes "The integration cut deploy time from 40 minutes to 4."
- Make verbs do the work: "made a decision" becomes "decided."
- Keep useful edge — strong opinions, blunt language, humor, honest admissions.
- Keep the writer's structure unless it hurts the piece. If you reorganize, say why.

## Words to cut

Banned: delve, foster, leverage, utilize, facilitate, empower, streamline, robust,
cutting-edge, paradigm shift, game changer, this is huge, this changes everything,
tapestry, realm, beacon, multifaceted, meticulous, intricate, paramount, transformative,
elevate, embark, supercharge, harness, ever-evolving.

Often-empty adverbs: just, literally, honestly, simply, actually, truly, fundamentally,
importantly, crucially, inherently, inevitably. Cut when they add nothing; keep when they
carry emphasis, uncertainty, contrast, or the writer's spoken rhythm.

Often-empty phrases: it's worth noting, it's important to note, at the end of the day,
when it comes to, at its core, in today's world, in the age of, the reality is, the truth
is, in terms of, in order to, going forward, in this article, let's dive in.

## Patterns to cut

- **Binary contrasts.** "It's not X, it's Y." State Y directly.
- **Throat-clearing openers.** "Here's the thing," "Let me be clear," "I'll be honest."
- **Faux-insight setups.** "What most people get wrong," "the part everyone misses."
  Cut the setup; let the claim stand alone.
- **Colon reveals.** "The best part: it learns." Rewrite as a plain sentence. Colons are
  for lists, labels, and quotes. Sentence case after a colon unless grammar requires
  otherwise.
- **Superficial analysis.** Trailing `-ing` clauses that fake meaning: "highlighting,"
  "underscoring," "reflecting," "showcasing." Say the actual consequence.
- **Importance puffery.** "Marks a pivotal moment," "stands as a testament," "plays a
  vital role." State the fact; let the reader judge.
- **Weasel attribution.** "Experts agree," "studies show." Name the source or cut it.
- **Fake-strong verbs.** Prefer "is" and "has" when clearer than "serves as a hub for."
- **Synonym cycling.** Repeat the right word instead of rotating terms for style.
- **Negative listing.** "Not a X. Not a Y. A Z." Just say Z.
- **Dramatic fragmentation.** "That's it. That's the whole thing." Use full sentences.
- **Robotic rhythm.** Vary sentence and paragraph shape only when it helps the point.
- **Rhetorical setups.** "What if I told you," "Think about it:", "Plot twist:".
- **Fake-profound kickers.** Delete the closing metaphor or mic-drop line; don't rewrite
  it into a better one. End on the clearest concrete sentence already there.
- **Summary-recap endings.** "In conclusion," "Ultimately," or a paragraph restating the
  piece. End on the last concrete point, takeaway, or next action.
- **Formatting slop.** Emoji headings, bold sprinkled mid-sentence, bullets where two
  sentences of prose read better, headers over two-sentence sections.
- **Em dashes.** None in short copy; 1-2 in a longer draft when they clearly beat commas,
  periods, or parentheses.

## The mechanical gate

Fix the em-dash budget before drafting: zero in short copy (social posts, commit messages,
titles, descriptions, UI strings, under ~150 words); at most two in long-form, bold labels
included; punctuate labels with colons. Count after drafting instead of eyeballing
(`grep -o '—' | wc -l` on a file), and grep for the banned words. Over budget means
restructure the sentence; a dash swapped for a colon keeps the same crutch. Published
material is not precedent for breaking any rule here.

## Workflow

1. Read the whole draft first.
2. Note the core point and 3-5 voice signals to preserve. Keep that note internal. If you
   can't find the core point, ask.
3. Detect request → return the findings report and stop.
4. Edit request → make the minimum effective changes, then run the checks below yourself.
5. Any check fails → fix and re-check.
6. Output the full edited draft and a short **What changed** section.

## Checks (answer pass/fail before returning)

1. Point preserved, nothing invented?
2. Distinctive vocabulary, cadence, and level of polish intact?
3. Strong human sentences left alone; cutting proportional to actual slop?
4. Active voice with human subjects where possible; concrete facts protected?
5. Banned words, empty adverbs, and filler phrases gone (unless quoted as examples)?
6. Every pattern above fixed — including kickers deleted rather than rewritten, and
   recap endings cut?
7. Formatting slop removed; em-dash budget verified by count (0 short copy, ≤2
   long-form); sentence case after colons?
8. No robotic symmetry or stacked punchy fragments?
9. Would the writer recognize this as their own voice, read aloud to a sharp colleague?
10. Output has the full draft plus a short **What changed** section (edit requests), or
    named patterns with quoted lines and no rewrite (detect requests)?

  Render a readable table; call out any `running` or `failed`.
- `<id>` (id or prefix) → show its full prompt + result/error:
  `SELECT prompt, status, result, error FROM agents WHERE id LIKE '<id>%';`
