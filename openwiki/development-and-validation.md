# Development and validation

## Purpose

The commands that build, test and prove a change, the narrowest one for each kind of
change, and the ways the machine's state is kept out of the record.

## Building

- A Cargo workspace of four crates. `cargo build` builds all; `cargo build -p rusty-app`
  builds the app (cxx-qt generates the bridges and runs moc on the two C++ classes in
  `crates/rusty-app/cpp/`; Qt 6 and `qmltermwidget` come from the system).
- One cargo command at a time, never killed: a killed or concurrent cargo corrupts the
  incremental cache.
- `omarchy/install.sh`: release builds of the three binaries into `~/.local/bin`, the
  desktop entry and icon (its `Exec` is `rusty session start`), the two user units
  (installed and enabled; the back end restarted and probed over HTTP; the app started
  through `rusty session start` when it was built and a graphical session is active), the
  MCP config snippets, and pointers to the compositor drop-in and the earlyoom line it does
  not apply. It deletes a stale `~/.local/bin/rusty-session` left by an earlier install.
  Idempotent.
- `packaging/PKGBUILD` (`rusty-git`) builds the same for the AUR, `!lto`, and installs
  both units (paths rewritten to `/usr/bin`; the app unit runs `/usr/bin/rusty session
  run`), the drop-in and the key snippet under `/usr/share/rusty/`. No wrapper script is
  packaged.

## Running as services

- `omarchy/rusty-mcp.service` is wanted by `default.target`, so the back end serves with
  or without a desktop. `Restart=always` brings it back two seconds after any exit but
  `systemctl --user stop`; a session teardown and earlyoom both send SIGTERM, which
  `on-failure` would treat as clean. `OOMScoreAdjust=100` is the lowest a user unit can
  set (the user manager's own score; its services default to 200).
- `omarchy/rusty-app.service` is wanted by and ordered after uwsm's
  `graphical-session.target`, stops with it (`PartOf`), runs in `app-graphical.slice`
  after `rusty-mcp.service`, restarts after any exit except status 0 (a quit stays quit,
  a kill or a crash comes back), and logs under the identifier `rusty`. systemd's start
  limit, five starts in ten seconds, ends a crash loop.
- `rusty session` is the one entry point the installer, the desktop entry and the key
  share (TICKET-029): a noun of the app binary, decided in `crates/rusty-app/src/session.rs`
  before Qt starts, in place of the `rusty-session` script TICKET-009 installed. `start`
  starts the back end, imports the display variables into the user manager when a
  compositor started outside uwsm left them out, refuses a second window while a `rusty`
  outside the unit is running (its own process and the unit's main pid excepted), and
  starts the app unit; `stop` stops the app unit alone; `status` reads both units, posts
  an `initialize` to the port and lists the app's processes; `run` is the unit's command:
  PATH completed with `~/.local/bin` and `~/.cargo/bin` in-process, then the window in the
  same process. Because the unit now executes the binary itself, a missing binary is a
  failed exec (systemd status 203) that `Restart=always` retries until the start limit
  ends it, where the script exited 0 and left the unit stopped. A test reads every file
  under `omarchy/` and `packaging/` and refuses the old invocations and any app-unit
  `ExecStart` other than `rusty session run`.
- `omarchy/wayland-wm-oom.conf` is a drop-in for the compositor unit (`OOMScoreAdjust=100`)
  that the installer points at and never applies, being another program's unit; the
  earlyoom avoid line, which needs root, is documented in `omarchy/README.md`. No Wayland
  client outlives its compositor: the next login starts the app unit, and the tmux
  sessions and the state files under `~/.config/rusty/` reattach.

## Testing

- `cargo test -p rusty-core`: the managers, the vault, the renderer, the scanner, the
  semantic index; scratch directories under the system temp dir, an in-memory database.
- `cargo test -p rusty-mcp`: the router tests and `tests/smoke.rs`, which spawns the
  built binary over stdio in a scratch `HOME` and walks tasks, resources and the
  workspace tools.
- `cargo test -p rusty-app`: the highlighter's tokenizer, the tabs JSON, the theme
  tokens and colour math, the command dispatch and PATH completion (`session::tests`), the
  theme directory's two locations against a scratch home, and the shipped-files check
  above.
- UI probes never drive the app with synthetic input on the user's desktop and never
  touch real data; screenshots and log checks stand in.

## The gate and CI

- `bin/gate.sh --fast` while working; `bin/gate.sh --diff` before delivery, which
  writes the receipt the commit hooks check; `--verify` to confirm it.
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs the same set on every push (Qt installed with apt,
  `QMAKE` pointed at Qt 6) as a second witness; it never replaces the local receipt.

## Screenshots and visual evidence

`scripts/screenshot.sh <dir> [scene ...]` builds a scratch vault of invented pages,
starts a scratch `rusty-mcp` on its own port, and runs the app offscreen
(`QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen`) with `RUSTY_SHOT`, `RUSTY_SHOT_SCENE`, `RUSTY_TABS`,
`RUSTY_STATE` and `RUSTY_OMARCHY_THEME_DIR` so that no real data, no workspace switch
and no user setting is involved; `SHOT_THEME`, `SHOT_SIZE`, `SHOT_ENV` and `SHOT_KEEP`
adjust it. The app grabs itself through `Tools.grabWindow`, because an item grab cannot
start on the offscreen platform. The images in `docs/screenshots/` come from it.

## Logs

- The back end logs to stderr (`journalctl --user -u rusty-mcp` for the service).
- The app under its unit: `journalctl --user -u rusty-app`, or `journalctl -t rusty`,
  the identifier the unit sets.
- The app's Qt messages go to journald when it is not started from a terminal
  (`journalctl --user -t rusty`); `QT_FORCE_STDERR_LOGGING=1` keeps them on stderr;
  `RUSTY_DEBUG=1` adds a line per tab, title, shot and settings event.

## Data on this machine

`~/.rusty/`: `rusty.db`, `brain/` (a git repository the managers commit to),
`notes/`, `skills/`, `.secret`. `~/.config/rusty/`: `tabs.json`, `workspace.json`,
`color-schemes/`. Tests and the screenshot script never use these paths.
