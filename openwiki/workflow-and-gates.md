# Workflow and gates: how a change moves through this repository

## Purpose

Every non-trivial change runs a spec-driven, phase-gated pipeline whose record is plain
files in the repository and whose proof is a pair of receipts bound to the worktree.
`CONSTITUTION.md` is the law; `AGENTS.md` (also `CLAUDE.md`) routes the work; the
`rusty-workflow` skill is the driving manual.

## Ownership

- `CONSTITUTION.md`: the quality gate (§0), the phases (§3), product boundaries (§10),
  code conventions (§14), evidence and anti-circumvention (§15), recall first (§18),
  the local record (§19), the amendment log.
- `docs/planning/`: intakes, tickets (`INDEX.md` holds the next number), the active
  spec/notes pair (at most one), completed pairs, the knowledge register (`PR-`, `BF-`,
  `AD-` IDs), AARs, bulletins.
- `bin/gate.sh`, `bin/lib-gate.sh`: the gate and the receipts.
- `.claude/hooks/`, `.claude/settings.json`: the guardrails.
- `scripts/`: the pipeline tools (`setup-pipeline-tools.sh`, `check-pipeline-tools.sh`,
  `check-pipeline.sh`, `codegraph.sh`, `mcp-codegraph.sh`, `mcp-openwiki.sh`,
  `lib-openwiki.sh`, `screenshot.sh`).
- `.claude/skills/rusty-workflow/` (the phases), `.claude/skills/openwiki/` (the wiki
  lifecycle).

## The phases

```
recall → plan → design → implement → inspect → validate → complete → delivery
```

- Recall: bulletins, the knowledge register, the nearest completed notes, this wiki,
  the architecture docs, the brain through the `rusty` MCP server.
- Plan: a ticket, a spec with EARS requirements (each with a verification), locked
  decisions, a notes file, an open AAR. A spec that changes what Rusty is carries the
  user's seal on its `sealed:` line.
- Design: architecture, a file manifest, store consequences, the tool contract, a
  regression table, risks, CodeGraph evidence over the symbols touched.
- Implement: the manifest, `bin/gate.sh --fast` green.
- Inspect: an adversarial ledger through fixed lenses, findings resolved.
- Validate: the tests with their real output, `bin/gate.sh --diff` green, the receipt.
- Complete: the requirement audit, the `openwiki` lifecycle finished `complete`, docs,
  the AAR, register entries, a brain capture, the pair archived.
- Delivery: `bin/gate.sh --verify` green, the staged diff read, a commit that names its
  ticket and carries the co-author trailer, the push, CI as the second witness.

## The gate and the receipts

- `bin/gate.sh --fast`: `cargo fmt --all --check`, `cargo clippy --workspace
  --all-targets -- -D warnings`, `cargo test --workspace`, one after another.
- `--diff` (the default) and `--full` add the doc build with warnings as errors, shell
  syntax, a secrets scan over the gated files, a whitespace check, and on green write
  `.git/rusty-gate-receipt`: `version`, `fingerprint`, `mode`, `at`.
- The fingerprint is a sha256 over `HEAD` and every gated file's path and content. Gated
  paths: `crates`, `Cargo.toml`, `Cargo.lock`, `rust-toolchain.toml`, `bin`, `scripts`,
  `omarchy`, `packaging`, `.claude`, `.codex`, `.mcp.json`, `.github`,
  `CONSTITUTION.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`. `docs/` and the roadmap are exempt, so a
  pipeline can write notes while a gate runs and docs-only changes commit without a
  receipt.
- `.git/rusty-openwiki-receipt` has the same shape plus the pipeline id. The
  PostToolUse hook writes it when `openwiki_finish` returns `complete`. Neither receipt
  is ever written by hand.
- `--verify` reports both receipts and exits on the gate receipt.

## The guardrails

- `enforce-phase-gate.sh` (PreToolUse on Edit and Write): a gated path changes only while
  the active spec is in an implementing phase, or under `docs/planning/pipeline/WAIVER.md`.
- `enforce-secrets.sh`: a write that contains credential-looking bytes is refused.
- `enforce-commit-gate.sh` (PreToolUse on Bash): a `git commit` that carries gated files
  needs a matching gate receipt; one that delivers a completed pipeline (a spec under
  `docs/planning/pipeline/completed/`) needs a matching OpenWiki receipt too, unless a
  waiver is in force; `--no-verify` is refused.
- `record-pipeline-tool-use.sh` (PostToolUse on `openwiki_finish`): the completion
  receipt.
- The git pre-commit shim installed by `scripts/setup-pipeline-tools.sh` applies the
  same two receipt rules to any tool that commits.

## The tools

- CodeGraph 1.5.0, project-local under `.dev/pipeline-tools/codegraph`, an MCP server
  (`codegraph`) and a CLI wrapper; `explore` and `impact` at design and inspect.
- OpenWiki 0.3.3, pinned to one commit, built from its frozen lockfile with a pnpm
  verified by SHA-512, patched twice (no scheduled refresh workflow, local-only guidance
  in the agent guides), recorded in a provenance file the check script verifies. It is
  used only through its MCP lifecycle (`openwiki_begin`, `openwiki_inspect_claims`,
  `openwiki_resolve_claims`, `openwiki_finish`); the host agent writes the pages, so
  nothing is sent to a provider. `scripts/check-pipeline.sh` verifies the wiring and
  keeps `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` identical.

## The brain loop's hooks

Two Claude Code hooks ship inside `rusty-cli` (`crates/rusty-cli/hooks/`, embedded in the
binary). `rusty-cli hooks install` writes them to `~/.rusty/hooks/` and adds a PreToolUse
entry (Edit, Write, MultiEdit, NotebookEdit) and a Stop entry to `~/.claude/settings.json`,
idempotently and keeping every other entry; `hooks status` and `hooks uninstall` exist. In
a working directory whose `.mcp.json` names a rusty server, the write hook blocks a write
under that directory until the transcript holds a `mcp__rusty__brain_ask` tool use whose
result was not an error (a file elsewhere, a scratch script, passes), and the stop hook
refuses a stop once when files were written and no non-error `brain_decide` or
`brain_no_decision` follows; `stop_hook_active` passes the retry. Both fail open without
jq or a readable transcript. The corpus test in `crates/rusty-cli/src/hooks.rs` runs the
shipped scripts under bash. The record is `docs/architecture/brain-loop.md`.

## Invariants

- Exactly one active spec/notes pair; the `status:` line of the spec is the truth about
  where the work stands.
- Phases close on evidence in the notes, never on a claim; a test that did not run did
  not pass.
- Cargo commands run one at a time and are never killed.
- Tests and probes never touch the user's real data.

## Failure modes

- A hook that is missing does not lower the bar; the receipts are the proof.
- A commit moves `HEAD`, so both receipts read stale right after it; the next gated
  commit needs its own gate run.

## Extension points

- A new gated path: `rusty_gated_paths` in `bin/lib-gate.sh`.
- A new phase rule: `CONSTITUTION.md` (with an amendment log entry) and
  `references/phases.md`.

## Tests

- The hooks have self-tests by synthetic input, recorded in the pipeline notes
  (TICKET-001, TICKET-007).
- `scripts/check-pipeline.sh` and `scripts/check-pipeline-tools.sh` are the structural
  checks.
