name: rusty-workflow
description: Run or resume the evidence-based Rusty work pipeline for any non-trivial feature, fix, migration, packaging or workflow change in the Ignibyte/rusty repo. Covers recall, the ticket and the spec/notes pair, EARS requirements, the design file manifest with CodeGraph evidence, the adversarial inspect ledger, the gate receipt, the AAR and the knowledge register. Use it before touching files; read references/phases.md completely.

# Rusty workflow

Read `AGENTS.md` and `CONSTITUTION.md`, then [references/phases.md](references/phases.md)
completely before changing files.

## Route the request

1. Look in `docs/planning/pipeline/active/`. If a spec/notes pair is there, resume it from
   its recorded `status:`; never open a second pipeline.
2. If the request is an idea rather than approved work, write an intake
   (`docs/planning/_templates/intake.md`) and stop; do not write application code.
3. If the user waives ceremony for a small change, write the reason to
   `docs/planning/pipeline/WAIVER.md`, do the change with the ordinary loop, run
   `bin/gate.sh --diff`, report the waiver, delete the file.
4. Otherwise run `scripts/check-pipeline.sh`, start Phase 1, and continue through the
   phases the requested outcome needs.

Before Phase 2, run `scripts/check-pipeline-tools.sh`; if CodeGraph is not prepared, run
`scripts/setup-pipeline-tools.sh`. A newly wired MCP server needs a session restart;
until then `scripts/codegraph.sh explore …` is the permitted fallback.

## Rules of the road

- The `status:` line of the active spec is the truth about where the work stands. Do
  not infer a phase from chat history.
- Never claim a gate, test or tool ran unless it did, and paste what it printed.
- Never commit without a matching receipt (`bin/gate.sh --verify`), never `--no-verify`,
  never touch `.git/rusty-gate-receipt` by hand.
- Tests and probes never touch Chad's real data: the smoke test uses a scratch `HOME`;
  UI probes use throwaway rows they create and delete by id.
- Pause only for a missing decision that would change scope, or when the user asked for
  phase-by-phase review. Otherwise drive to the requested outcome.

At handoff report: the phase reached, changed surfaces, tests and gate results with
their real output, unresolved requirements, and delivery status (commit SHA, pushed or
not).
